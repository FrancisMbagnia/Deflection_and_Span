# ProjectileCalc üöÄüéØ: Trajectory Calculation and Plotting

ProjectileCalc is a project designed to calculate the trajectory, range, and plot the curve of a projectile motion. Whether you're a physics enthusiast, a student studying projectile motion, or simply curious about the path of objects in motion, ProjectileCalc provides a powerful toolset to explore and visualize projectile trajectories.

## Features ‚ú®

- Calculate the trajectory of a projectile based on initial conditions.
- Determine the maximum height, flight time, and range of the projectile.
- Plot the trajectory curve with customizable visualizations.
- Adjust parameters such as initial velocity and launch angle for experimentation.
- Gain insights into the physics of projectile motion through visual representations.

## Usage üéØ

Here's an example of calculating and plotting the trajectory of a projectile:

1. Launch ProjectileCalc and enter the initial velocity and launch angle.
2. Calculate the trajectory to obtain information about its path.
3. Choose the "Plot Curve" option to visualize the projectile's trajectory.

## Examples üìà

Explore the "examples" folder to discover various scenarios showcasing different projectile trajectories and visualizations.

## Contribute ü§ù

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to ProjectileCalc, please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information.
